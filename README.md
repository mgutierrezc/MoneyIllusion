# oTree replication of "Does Money Illusion Matter?" - Fehr and Tyran 2001 
**Programmer:** Marco Gutierrez

Initially, this project was created to replicate the experimental design done by the authors of this paper. Initially, this was done as a task for one of the professors I work with, but because the project was left behind, it's new purpose is to have an oTree version of this code that can be easily edited for future research projects.

## oTree App
Located on the `FT2001` folder. There is still some work to be done like

1. Incorporate the payoff function on the app

1. Creating a table that depends on the payoff function

1. Create a high chart that displays the row and column of an specific value of the payoff table

1. Frontend changes in most of the templates

1. Alpha and Beta Testing

## Payoffs
You can find a function that replicates exactly the real payoffs of the paper on the `testing_payoff` folder. It has been programmed on a Jupyter Notebook called `Debugging Payoff Function`.

## Contact
This is still an ongoing personal project, so feel free to contact me about it by sending an email to this address: [ma.gutierrezch@up.edu.pe](mailto:ma.gutierrezch@up.edu.pe)
